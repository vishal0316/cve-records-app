# Records Management Application

This is a React application for managing CVE  records using Vite, Tailwind CSS, and Shadcn for UI improvements. The application allows users to view, add, edit, delete, sort, and filter CVE records.

## Features

1. **View CVE Records:**
    - Display a table layout showing CVE records.
    - Include columns for CVE-ID, Severity, CVSS, Affected Packages, and CWE-ID.
    - Each row represents a single CVE record with its corresponding details.
    - Add "Edit" and "Delete" options in each row to allow users to edit or delete the corresponding CVE record.

2. **Add CVE Record:**
    - Provide an "Add CVE" button.
    - When the "Add CVE" button is clicked, open a modal dialog box.
    - Inside the modal, include input fields for CVE-ID, Severity, CVSS, Affected Packages, and CWE-ID.
    - Add "Save" and "Cancel" buttons to confirm or cancel the addition of the new CVE record.
    - Validate input data to ensure all required fields are filled before saving the new CVE record.

3. **Edit CVE Record:**
    - Include an "Edit" option in each row of the CVE table.
    - When the "Edit" option is clicked, open a modal dialog pre-filled with the existing CVE details for editing.
    - Allow users to modify the details of the CVE record within the modal dialog.
    - Add "Save" and "Cancel" buttons to confirm or cancel the changes made to the CVE record.
    - Validate input data to ensure all required fields are filled before saving the new CVE record.

4. **Delete CVE Record:**
    - Include a "Delete" option in each row of the CVE table.
    - When the "Delete" option is clicked, prompt the user with a confirmation message asking if they're sure they want to delete the CVE record.
    - Provide options to confirm or cancel the deletion of the CVE record.
    - If confirmed, permanently remove the CVE record from the data entries.

5. **Sorting and Filtering:**
    - Provide filtering options to allow users to view CVE records based on specific criteria.
